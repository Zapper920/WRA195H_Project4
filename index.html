            With the rising prices of college tuition, many graduating high school seniors have begun to wonder if alternative means of education. Although alternative means of education can be pursued, each option has its benefits, but also it's detriments. Below shows a comparison of the pros and cons of pursuing post-secondary education in graphic design.

          There is no singular option for students; this major life choice requires delineation and a careful understanding of the consequences of either option. I found personally that the benefits of university outweighed the consequence of the cost. However, different lifestyles permit different options: the only correct decision is an informed one.

            MSU, typical of a formal institution, requires learning a mix of both the contemporary and traditional modes of instruction. All AAHD (Art, Art History, and Design) students are required to take courses in the fundamentals of art and the principles of design. Following this prerequisite, students are able to take more complex courses in typography and graphic form. Below is an outline of the typical course pathway for a student pursuing a BFA in Graphic Design:
            <div id="GDMapContainer"><img src="./assets/AAHD_GD-BFA-Map_3pg_21.svg"></div>
            In addition to the required courses, students are also expected to complete a portfolio review and internship. These, in my opinion, are some of the most practical requirements, as they provide students with valuable experience and resources which employers care about.

            Beyond receiving their undergraduate degree, students will often pursue an MFA (Master’s in Fine Arts). Generally, these typically follow a residency or independent study structure. Students generally pursue this option to expand their design abilities and marketability, as an alternative to directly entering the field.

                <p class="card-text">The demand for digital designers was sparked largely by the “dot-com” bubble of the late 1990s to early 2000s. The early internet was a completely new frontier, and print designers eagerly capitalized on it. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the amount of graphic designers nearly doubled between 1999 and 2007, the height of the dot-com bubble. During this period, graphic design jobs increased at a much higher rate than the rate of overall employment. However, during the period of 2009-2013, the Graphic Design industry experienced a small recession. The dot-com bubble had burst, and investors and businesses alike found the internet as a much less lucrative venture. The industry has since been in a slight recession due to the current oversaturation of the field. </p>

When compared with the Consumer Price Index, a common means for calculating general inflation, wages have risen fairly proportionally to the rising price of goods. From 2019 to 2021, however, there has been a somewhat dramatic increase in wages relative to the rate of inflation. This suggests that graphic design could be a more advantageous career to enter in the coming years, if this trend is to continue. That being said, a similar increase can be seen from 1999 to 2001, only for the wages to then decrease the following year, and continue to follow the rate of inflation.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Currently, the field of graphic design offers a multitude of diverse career paths. Although the mean annual salary of designers in the US in 2021 was $59,970, only $1,690 over the average of all occupations, increased salaries can be found in different levels of career progression. Typically, the career path for a designer consists of junior, mid-level, and senior positions, requiring roughly &lt;2, 2-5, and &gt;5 years of experience respectively. In addition designers often move to managerial positions such as art or creative directors. In recent years, additional positions have opened as a result of the advent of digital technologies. UI/UX design and web development, for instance, are fields with a high rate of demand right now. With the cross-over and commonalities between graphic design and these fields, many designers are migrating to these positions due to their generally higher wages. </p>

        <tr>
            <td>LD:</td>
            <td>All right, thank you. So now I have a couple meatier kind of questions here, and you can answer these as briefly or however you want to answer them. So in what way and to what extent has the field of graphic design education adapted to meet the needs of the increasingly digital modern world?  </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>AT:</td>
            <td>Well, a big focus right now in in both graphic design education and in the industry as a whole is accessibility and inclusivity. So in the professional setting, you're seeing a lot more websites and brand identity packages and projects that are built with accessibility in mind. And this can take a few different forms. Primarily what I see in the digital setting is making sure that, you know, colors and typefaces are being used that aren't going to give anybody who has any kind of visual impairment or disability difficulty to read. There's also a lot of work being done to structure digital experiences, like websites and apps, in such a way that if somebody has like a screen reader or something like that they are able to, you know, successfully navigate the page. <br> <br>
            As far as how that translates to education, the course that I teach is primarily focused on sort of a digital set of tools that designers might use in a very common sort of industry standard platform, which is the Adobe Creative suite, although we do branch out. So in this course, I don't really talk too much about accessibility in the course materials and in the curriculum. Some of the feedback I might give students might suggest, “hey, you know, if you're using typeface like this, you might want to be aware of this because this is a consideration of things that are happening out in the world”. I do know that the department of Art, Art History and Design at Michigan State has put an emphasis on inclusivity and and accessibility as far as how they're structuring their courses. How that plays out with their instructor's course materials, I'm not really sure. So that's one way I think that design education and the design practice is sort of rising to meet sort of the digital needs and digital platforms that are being used more widely. <br> <br>
            I think that there is an emphasis too on continued education. It's just as important to know how to learn as a designer as it is to know what to learn. And because things move so quickly, like we're seeing right now with AI and things like that, it's really important, even when you're not a student any longer, to continue to try and search out and continue to build your skill set and continue to learn though. The company that I work for puts a big emphasis on professional and personal development because of this, because technology changes and the world changes. And so in this course in particular, I don't necessarily talk about this so much in the digital design tools course. But in courses that I've taught in the past, like Graphic Design I, Typography I and Typography II at Michigan State, that is something that I've really strongly emphasized. Because I had the misconception when I was an undergraduate student graduating then, “I'm like, OK. I've done it. I've I've got my degree. I'm going to go get a big, fancy design job now, and I'm fully prepared and ready to go”. And I had a bit of a rude awakening when I got the professional setting because things just continue to change and develop and you really have to focus in on that. And so, I was lucky enough to have mentors early on in my career that really hit home like “hey, you have to continue to grow and learn and focus on these things”. And so I tried to bring that into the courses where I have a more sort of lecture based format that's not so sort of like technical skill focused like the digital design tools course that that you're in. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>LD:</td>
            <td>All right. Would you say that learning how to learn design and how to adapt, is that something that is only able to be learned in a formal institution or have you seen that be something that graphic designers can pick up in the field? </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>AT:</td>
            <td>I think that's something that you can pick up in the field and frankly, I think that generations, I'm 37, so generations of designers younger than me are even better at it than I was. I think that there is such a ubiquity of resources that you can find on your own that if you're somebody who is motivated to continue to grow and develop, there are so many different places you can go. I mean YouTube is a huge huge platform for this reason. You know more and more of, you know, Gen. Z and younger end of the millennials, and even the generation under that are pulling more towards videos and things like that to self educate, grow their their skill sets and their interests in ways that they choose. I think that the benefit of a formal education institute like Michigan State versus that sort of self education is that there are a lot of foundational skill sets and modes of thinking that have sort of evolved through generations of designers and art teaching that sort of has a really solid platform for that continued learning to sort of rest upon. You know, how to think about design and how to work through the design process are things that you can certainly find resources for and self educate, but having a sort of a cohort of students that you can move through that experience with and be in dialogue with each other and each other's work I think, is really beneficial.</td>

            <td>Yeah, you know it was a little bit different for me in my Graduate School experience because the cohort was a little bit smaller, but when I was an undergrad at the University of Utah, we had a core group that moved through the entire program to get there. And so we were able to sort of be in dialogue with each other's work and help push each other forward in a way that was different than how our professors were motivating us, and that sort of built our community and I think helped us all be better designers and helped us all take our work to places that it might not have gone individually. </td>

            <td>OK. I wanted to touch back to your first point on accessibility really quickly. So for accessibility, is that something that has been a focus of graphic designers very recently, or is that something that has been a focus going back to like the beginning of the Internet? </td>

            <td>Not so much the beginning of the Internet as far as like this is a big conversation that's happening in design. I would say it's more recent, especially, and this is anecdotally, but based on my career, it's really been in the last five years where people talked about it more, where you know, and not just accessibility for for people that might have some kind of a vision or hearing or, you know, different way of learning or something like that, but also representation and inclusivity in that way as well has  been something that's been much more emphasized and talked about in the design world. I mean even in what's happening now is you're seeing a lot of like Adobe is putting out like a lot of templates and sort of bases that people can use and illustration sets that people can pull on, and even those components, you'll find it much more sort of what representation of different communities demographics, you know, races, backgrounds, et cetera. People are trying to pay much more attention to it now versus, say, five years ago, at least in my opinion. </td>

            <td>Yeah, I think that's part of it. I think that part of it is certainly motivated by by culture and and our times, the zeitgeist as as you were referring to it. But also there are some real practical things that have happened in the last 5 to 10 years, like Domino's got sued because their website wasn't accessible to somebody. He was using a screen reader, and they couldn't navigate the page to order a pizza the way they wanted to. So there have been some legal cases that have cropped up that are similar to the cases that happened that resulted in the American Disabilities Act where, you know, all of a sudden, you know, businesses were needing to install wheelchair ramps and things like that. So there, there is a legal aspect to it as well. I can't quite recall what the outcome of the Domino's lawsuit is, but it's a big enough conversation that even, we work with government contractors, for example, sometimes that are, you know, like for example, we just developed a brand identity for a government contractor, and we had to take into consideration and color accessibility because when they submit their proposals to the government, it has to pass a certain level of contrast accessibility so that somebody can read it if they have a visual impairment of some kind. And that's like a requirement through the federal government. It's a little bit looser what those restrictions are when it comes to like individual businesses, but something that we're trying to safeguard clients that we work with, and it's a thing that I want to talk to students about too when I get a chance. Because I just think that makes it better world for everybody if more people are able to come to the table and feel included. You know whether that's somebody who's able to read the typeface of a identity that somebody designed or being able to navigate through their website or app screen reader or something.</td>

            <td>I was not aware of the legal implications of that, that's interesting, thank you. I do have another question here. So what do you think is the biggest challenge facing graduates who are looking to enter the professional world? </td>

            <td>I think that there's a lot of economic uncertainty right now that would feel maybe a little bit intimidating to graduating students. I think that there can be a disconnect between the modes of working in an academic setting versus the modes of working in a professional setting. I can only sort of speak to my own experiences, but one thing that I struggled with when I entered into the professional role after completing my undergraduate degree was that there is a speed and efficiency that you have to work at in a professional setting that you don't necessarily have as a student. Like as a student you have deadlines and things like that, but the pressure is a little bit different in the professional setting where you know, like for example we will bill a project or estimate a project out based on a certain amount of hours, and that certain amount of hours is based on like the rate of our shop and it's based on the budget of the client it's based on the scope of work and then we segment that all out into individual stages, and there's a certain hour amount that's allotted to each individual stage so that means that for like an initial stage of a project when I'm doing a whole bunch of sketches, I have to be able to move fast. Then I have to be able to get to a certain point within like 3 hours and then for the next step I have to be able to refine that and narrow within 2 hours, 3 hours. And so the speed and the pressure is different, and also you have to be fast, fast, fast with the tools that you use. That's why courses like the digital design class that you're part of I think is really valuable. I didn't have something like that when I was a student. I had wonderful professors when I was an undergraduate at the University of Utah, but they were of a generation of designers that have photo typesetting and like manual layout reproduction as part of their process where they're actually like, physically laying out typefaces and images and illustrations and big galleries and then photographing them. And then they have to sort of adopt into the early tool set of like, “hey, here's a Mac, you better sort of get on board with this because you're going to be competing with designers that are able to move a lot faster with it”. So they didn't really strongly emphasize, “Hey, here's how you might use these tools. Here's some basic steps on how you might do something like this in illustrator. Here's how you do something like this in Indesign. Here's an assignment that's going to help you sort of build some foundational skills to understand the way these platforms work”. It was much more like, “Here is the assignment here are the tools you might use, figure it out”. So I think that there's... You know, I've kind of rambled and I've lost track of your initial question. </td>

            <td>I'm sorry I've been battling a cold and I'm on some cold medicine that's making my little bit foggy. Yeah, so I think, in looking at Michigan State's design program now, I feel like it's a bit different than when I was a student. So maybe the technological leap is a little bit less, but I would think that the biggest challenge that students coming into the industry now are going to face is getting in the door for the first job, and then being able to find somebody in that setting that's going to help, sort of mentor them and stick with them forward and really being able to understand that they have to continue pushing on their own skill set and abilities as a designer to continue to grow and thrive in that setting. I think that Michigan State does a pretty good job of preparing students for that, and like getting the required portfolios ready and being able to present those portfolio reviews that are really, really valuable. But it's still a bit of a leap. It's intimidating in a different way and it's hard. At least it was for me when you don't get the first few jobs that you really want to not feel like so personally rejected. But the considerations in a professional setting are really different. You know, you could be up against somebody that has five years of experience for an entry level position, which is tough when you're a student. And  there's sometimes unrealistic expectations that employers can have about students, you know. They want an entry level position with ten years of experience. It doesn't really make sense if it's entry level. So how do you get in the door? So I think that that's a pretty significant challenge to learners. </td>

            <td>So would you say then that one of the major benefits of a formal institution like Michigan State University is just preparing that portfolio and getting your foot in the door over being like self-taught? </td>

        <tr>
            <td>AT:</td>
            <td>I think it's both. I think that it's it's about helping to prepare you for for the industry, right? I mean, that's why a lot of students go to college is because that's what you're supposed to do. That's your next step before you enter into your professional career. That's something that's kind of like baked into our societal narratives. But I also think that equally as important is learning how to think critically, learning how to continue to learn and and learning how to think through the design process, because design in particular is very process oriented. You know some designers see it as sort of a research based creative practice or intellectual based. I see it as an intellectual based creative practice. It's about problem solving about taking information and reprocessing it and trying to find a solution. So that is also a big benefit, I think of formal institutions. You have a lot of people around you that have a lot of experience that, on the professor side that, help you learn how to think just as well as they help you build your portfolio by yourself in the professional setting. </td>
